# PIZZA DELIVERY APPLICATION

## Task Overview :-

In my web development and Designing internship I completed the level 3 task. The information of the task is given below.

1. Crafting the Pizza Delivery App: The journey began with a deep dive into the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. Leveraging these technologies, I contributed to the creation of a dynamic and responsive app that allows users to customize their pizzas and place orders with ease.

2. Pizza Customization Flow: The app’s highlight was its intuitive pizza customization flow. Users could choose from a variety of pizza bases, sauces, cheeses, and different (veg or non-veg) toppings, creating a personalized pizza experience.

3. Payment Integration with Razorpay: To ensure secure transactions, I seamlessly integrated Razorpay test mode for payment processing.

4. Inventory Management and Product Stock Updates: For the admin side, i implemented a mini inventory management system. It tracked the availability of ingredients, updating stock levels after each order. This ensured a smooth and efficient process for both users and admin.And admin will be able to see notifications if any product’s quantity falls below a threshold, ensuring timely replenishment and preventing any disruption in service.

5. Gratitude to Oasis Infobyte: I am immensely grateful to the entire Oasis Infobyte team for their guidance and support throughout this internship journey. The collaborative environment, mentorship, and the opportunity to work on a project that combines technology and user experience have been invaluable.
